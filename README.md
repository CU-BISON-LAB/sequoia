# Sequoia: Enabling Quality-of-Service in Serverless Computing

This is the repository for our paper, *Sequoia: Enabling Quality-of-Service in Serverless Computing*.

The `sequoia/` folder includes the implementation of a new drop-in QoS function chain scheduler that alleviates problems uncovered in the measurement study of the paper. The scheduler can accurately realize a variety of flexible policies to make serverless function chain management more effective.
